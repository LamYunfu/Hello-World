# Hello-World
This is my first repository in GitHub
hello everyone, I am a student major in CS in China. This is my first jorney on GitHub, and I want to learn how to create a project 
and learn how to run it. I've learned C and C++ in school and Java by myself. I am learning how to use GitHub now. And if you are 
reading this memo by accident, it's my great honor. Hoping to learn more on GitHub!
